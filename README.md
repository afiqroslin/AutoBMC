# AutoBMC

I created this project a while ago when I was working as Firmware Validation Engineer. My job requires me to run test and validate our product on 60 servers and it is such a hassle to remote into each server through BMC one by one. So, I created this script to streamline the login process just by choosing the hostname of the server system I wanted to remote in.

However, I made a little modification in this repo because I don't have access to the servers anymore and this repo is only to showcase the project I've worked on previously.
I changed the IP address of the servers into twitter so we can see how the script demonstrate automatic login to twitter.
By making few adjustments, this script can be used to automate login into any websites.
